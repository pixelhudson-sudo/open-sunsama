/**
 * Centralised React Query key factories.
 *
 * Each domain hook (`useTasks`, `useTimer`, `useTimeBlocks`, …) used to
 * own + export its own `*Keys` factory. That meant `useWebSocket`, which
 * only needs the keys to invalidate caches on incoming events, was
 * pulling the full mutation/state code of every domain hook into its
 * dependency tree — and `useWebSocket` is mounted at the app shell,
 * which then sucked all of those modules into the boot bundle.
 *
 * Pulling the key factories into this leaf-level file lets the entry
 * chunk import only the tiny key shapes while the heavy mutation code
 * stays behind whatever route or component actually uses it.
 *
 * Domain hooks re-export their own key from here for backwards
 * compatibility so consumers like `useTasks.taskKeys` keep working.
